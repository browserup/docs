title: generate
---
The *generate* command is useful for getting working hello world files in a
particular environment for your test.


The generate command creates in the local directory:
* a browserup.yaml test config
* an example set of files for that test-type

Note that, the test configs are not actually specialized to test types, and
profiles can be made for multiple different test types in a single test config.

The generated files are useful as scaffolding for starting your test creation.

```bash
browserup help generate
