title: stop
---
The stop command stops a test. The stop command *does not* [destroy](../../cluster/commands/destroy.html) the cluster!
The containers remain up, and running until you [destroy](../../cluster/commands/destroy.html) them.

If you pass **-d** to stop, it will __also__ destroy the cluster.
