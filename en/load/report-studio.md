The Report Studio lets you build a report for any run, whether it is running or
not. If the test is running, the report itself will live update as the results come in.

Not every type of counter applies to every test, so make sure you're working
with counters that apply to the test type you're running.

Metrics like:

- Websocket metrics (ws) will only apply to tests with websocket traffic
- Step metrics only apply if steps have been defined for your tests

The URL metrics provide a good counter to investigate first.
