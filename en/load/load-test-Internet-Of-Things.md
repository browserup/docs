title: Load Testing Internet Of Things Software
---

The BrowserUp approach to load testing enables any "thing that makes requests" to
become the engine of a load test.  That includes arbitrary binaries that make requests.
Our tool will containerize, scale, and execute any artifact you can provide.

Currently, the only real restriction is that the binary must work on our Debian Bullseye image.
In the future, we plan to make some changes that will remove this restriction.
