In <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #de792b;">Browser</span><span style="font-weight: bold; color: #6e6e6e;">Up</span>, users, scenarios, tests, and data are segmented into Workspaces.

A workspace is like a "mini-account" with separated data.

The *superadmin* user has the power to create workspaces, and assign users and
admins to those workspaces.

In order to administer the workspace, sign in as superadmin, and use the top-right
menu to view a user, and assign them to a workspace.

Workspaces are created via licenses. To purchase a [license](/en/admin/licensing), contact [sales@browserup.com](sales@browserup.com)
